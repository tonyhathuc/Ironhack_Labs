# Lab | Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

Creating a Jupyter notebook that is well commented and tells the story of your code / project is very important. It will be relevant for your upcoming projects during the bootcamp.

## Getting Started

Open the jupyter notebook file `main.ipynb` in the `your-code` directory. Inside the file you should do the following steps:

- In the notebook that you created, introduce someone and her/his holidays preference with a picture and a link to a youtube video of this holiday preference (It can be you :D). √
- Explain the purpose of the notebook with beautiful markdown! √
- Include an index to the relevant sections of your notebook √
- Write a function that inputs the user's name (You or a friend) √
- Add a photo of you or that friend. √
- Write a function that inputs their holidays preference. √
- Add a photo of you or that friend in the holiday destination √ 
- Add bullet points of the top 3 things that you or your friend like doing in this destination. √ 
- Try to make the text colorful, bold or italic. √
- Add a link to a youtube video of the destination. √ 
- Add titles to all sections you have created, and then create hyperlinks from the elements of the index to their corresponding section title. √

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
